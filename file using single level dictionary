Sample input:
1. Create file: filename.txt
2. Delete file: filename.txt
3. List files in directory
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter file name: filename.txt
Enter your choice: 3
Sample Output:
Files in directory:
1. filename1.txt
2. filename2.txt
3. Filename3.txt
Result: Thus the c program to organize the file using a single-level directory is executed successfully.
15. Design a C program to organize the file using a two-level directory structure.
Aim: to organize files by creating a two-level directory structure based on certain criteria, such as file type or file name prefix.
Algorithm:
1.
Open the current directory.
2.
Read each file in the directory
